# go-web-example

Just a little REST service to brush up on some golang. There is a ton of
overkill stuff in here like multiple datastores, signal handling, timeout
fiddling, config parsing, etc. None if this is needed for a toy app, but I
wanted to jog my memory how I'd done these things in the past.
